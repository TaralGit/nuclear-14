## About the PR
<!-- What does it change? What other things could this impact? -->


**Media**
<!-- 
PRs which make ingame changes (adding clothing, items, new features, etc) are required to have media attached that showcase the changes.
Small fixes/refactors are exempt.
Any media may be used in SS14 progress reports, with clear credit given.

If you're unsure whether your PR will require media, ask a maintainer.
